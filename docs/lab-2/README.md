# Energy Demand Forecasting - Preprocessing and Performance Evaluation

TinyTimeMixers (TTMs) are compact pre-trained models for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting, open-sourced by IBM Research. With less than 1 Million parameters, TTM introduces the notion of the first-ever "tiny" pre-trained models for Time-Series Forecasting. TTM outperforms several popular benchmarks demanding billions of parameters in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting and can easily be fine-tuned for multi-variate forecasts.

In this lab, we move beyond simple prediction to training a Preprocessor and evaluating the model. We evaluate the performance of our model on a real-world dataset containing energy demand data from Spain.

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow the instructions in [pre-work](https://ibm-granite-community.github.io/granite-timeseries-workshop/pre-work/) to run the lab.
