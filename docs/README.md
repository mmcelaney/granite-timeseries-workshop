# Introduction

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the open-sourced [IBM Granite
AI foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) for a number of use cases that
demonstrates the value of [timeseries forecasting](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/time-series-forecasting) and [generative AI](https://developer.ibm.com/generative-ai-for-developers).

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Energy Demand Forecasting with Granite Timeseries (TTM)
* Energy Demand Forecasting with Granite Timeseries - Preprocessor Use and Performance Evaluation
* Energy Demand Forecasting with Granite Timeseries - Few-shot Fine-tuning and Evaluation
* Transportation Demand Forecasting with Granite Time Series - Zero-shot Inference and Fine-tuning with Exogenous Inputs
* Getting Started with Time Series Models on IBM watsonx
* Retail Sales Forecasting using the M5 dataset with Granite Time Series - Few-shot finetuning, evaluation, and visualization
