# Getting Started with Watson X AI SDK

This lab demonstrates using the watsonx SDK to perform inference calls against a model hosted remotely on [watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai).

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow the instructions in [pre-work](https://ibm-granite-community.github.io/granite-timeseries-workshop/pre-work/) to run the lab.
